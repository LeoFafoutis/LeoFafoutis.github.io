            <p>Taking a look at <a href="https://youtu.be/xlX3yre8aIo"> PlatChat's Overwatch Tracer Tier list </a>, we
                want to see what stats correlate to the assigned rank. The entire code can be viewed <a
                    href="code.html">here</a> under the code tab. I want to preface this by saying stats in Overwatch
                are very flimsy. This is a fun project and the results are not meant to be taken too seriously when
                looking at players. Please keep this in mind when reading the results. </p>

            <br><br>
            <h1>PlatChat Tier List</h1>
            <div class="img-cont"><img src="tracer_ranks.png"></div>

            <h1>Impact Rating</h1>
            <p>
                We begin by ranking the players based solely on their stats and how they compare to others within the
                list. Removing stats such as 'time discorded' or 'time hacked' to make sure the stats we use are only
                based on the players' performance and not outside factors. This will leave us with 29 various stats as
                shown below:

                <br><br>
                ['All Damage Done', 'Assists', 'Average Time Alive', 'Critical Hit Kills - Avg per 10 Min', 'Damage -
                Pulse Bomb', 'Damage - Quick Melee', 'Damage - Weapon', 'Damage Taken', 'Deaths', 'Defense Contest Time
                - Avg per 10 Min', 'Eliminations', 'Final Blows', 'Hero Damage Done', 'Melee Final Blows', 'Multikills',
                'Obj Contest Time - Avg per 10 Min', 'Objective Kills', 'Objective Time', 'Offense Contest Time - Avg
                per 10 Min', 'Pulse Bomb Attach Rate', 'Pulse Bomb Efficiency', 'Pulse Bomb Kills', 'Pulse Bomb Recalls
                - Avg per 10 Min', 'Self Healing Percent of Damage Taken', 'Solo Kills', 'Time Building Ultimate', 'Time
                Elapsed per Ultimate Earned', 'Time Holding Ultimate', 'Time Played']

                <br><br>
                We convert the values so all stats are in the scale of 'per 10 min'. We also normalize the data so all
                values are between 0 and 1, then add each normalized value to create an 'impact rating'. In theory if a
                player is at the top of each stat, they would score a perfect 29. We can then rank the players and
                display them in the following graph:
            </p>

            <div class="img-cont"><img src="rank_PIR_tracer.png"></div>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                The rankings are fairly similar to PlatChat's with a few changes, such as ranking Speedily and
                Choisehwan in the middle. However this method uses many statistics that may or may not be important. It
                also assumes each statistic has the same level of importance, which also may not be true. What we can do
                instead is look at the PlatChat rankings and see which statistics correlate to high ranks. Using
                spearman's rank correlation coefficient and converting our S, A, B, C, D tiers to 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 values
                respectively, we see:</p>

            <h1>Correlation Ratings</h1>
            <div class="img-cont"><img src="Correlation.png"></div>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                Our top 5 stats that correlate to high ranks are Final Blows, Critical Hit Kills, Average Time
                Alive, Eliminations, and Pulse Bomb Kills. The higher each of these values are, the more likely that
                player will be a high rank. Time Elapsed per Ultimate Earned is also important, but will decrease the
                higher a player is rated.

                <br><br>

                Interestingly enough, finals blows having the highest correlation to rank might be a result of the way
                we view the Overwatch League. Since the killfeed is the main way viewers can gather information about
                what is happening, it would only make sense we rank players higher based on how often we see them in the
                killfeed. However, it may also be that final blows are simply a result of being a better tracer and
                makes them appear in the killfeed more.

                <br><br>

                In the end, Overwatch is a very nuanced game and we can only assume so much about the stats involved. I
                appreciate you taking the time to read through this article and hope to include more soon.
